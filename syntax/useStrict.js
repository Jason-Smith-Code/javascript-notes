"use strict"; // Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode".

// new in ECMAScript version 5

// Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.
// Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors.
// In strict mode, any assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object, will throw an error.
