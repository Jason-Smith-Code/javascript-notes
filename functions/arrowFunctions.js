// difference between tradiation functions and arrow functions
// Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to this, arguments or super, and should not be used as methods.
// Arrow functions don't have access to the new.target keyword.
// Arrow functions aren't suitable for call, apply and bind methods, which generally rely on establishing a scope.
// Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors.
// Arrow functions cannot use yield, within its body.
