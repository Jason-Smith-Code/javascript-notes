# Setting up the config file
in package.json, we need a script
"tsc" : "tsc"
This tells us, that we can type tsc in terminal, and it will run tsc (type script compiler)
npm run tsc -- --init
This creates the tsconfig.json file in the current directory, uncomment out settings I want to add, and change any that need changed.
